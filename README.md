Hullo 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

This is meant to be a convenient, public repo for tracking bugs and new feature requests for Khronos Calendar! Feel free to submit a new issue and use either the 'Bug' or 'Feature Request' template.

It's just me working on Khronos so I'll do my best to keep up with any bug reports!

### Pro tips for sumbitting a bug or feature request

Please make sure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) account, it's easy and free to setup.

When filling out a bug or feature request, please fill in as much of the form as possible - it will really help me out!

Please be polite and kind in discussions!

Before sumbitting a bug report, please do a quick search to see if anybody else has already filed the report. If you find an existing issue already, please react with an emoji and add any additional infomation in the comments!

### Submitting a Bug Report

Tap on the "Issues" tab and fill in the "Bug" form. Please include clear reproducible steps, or if you can't reproduce the bug consistently, that's okay too - just let me know. 

### Sumitting a Feature Request

Tap on the "Issues" tab and fill in the "Feature Request" form. Feel free to go crazy here! Write up a description, attach an image with drawings, a video - really whatever you want! If you see another feature request that you think is a good idea, react with an emoji or leave a comment!
